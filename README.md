### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Java and Javascript are not the same in any way! Javascript programs are interpreted in the browser while Java programs must be compiled and can stand alone on applications. Java is more strict while Javascript is a more loosely-typed language.
2. Variable scope means where the variable code is known. There is a global scope and local scope. When it is a global variable, the variable is known throughout the program. Local scope is only known inside of that specific variable. If you declare a variable inside of that function, it is only available in that location where it was originally declared.
3. A function is something that does something for you. It is one or more lines of code that are grouped together to perform a particular task. Every function always ends in an open and closed parentheses.
